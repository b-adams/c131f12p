 @brief Compute a power of 2

 This works by using the fact that 2^n is twice 2^(n-1), and 2^0 is 1
 So, if the user gives 0 for n, this just returns n
 Otherwise, it returns twice the value of twoToThe(n-1)

 Walks through subtracting 2^0, multiplying by 2^2, adding 2^3, dividing by 2^1,
 and then subtracting twice the original number.

 @brief Pause until the user is ready to continue

 which will scan for the next letter in the stream. If the user presses
 enter, a newline will be the next character, getchar will finish, and
 the rest of the program will continue.
