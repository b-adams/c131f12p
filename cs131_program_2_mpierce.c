 @brief The answer that the trick always comes up with
 
 For not-very-mysterious algebraic reasons, this trick will always come up
 with the same answer. Rather than have '2' randomly show up in our code as
 a 'magic number', we give it a name here.

 @brief Compute a power of 2

 This works by using the fact that 2^n is twice 2^(n-1), and 2^0 is 1
 So, if the user gives 0 for n, this just returns n
 Otherwise, it returns twice the value of twoToThe(n-1)
 [We'll talk about this 'recursion' trick later in the class. It's very useful.]
